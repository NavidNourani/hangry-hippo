                    Owning a Hangry Sad Gorilla of your own gives you exclusive
                    lifetime access to HANGRY.TOOLS, so you can up your
                    investing game. As a holder, youâ€™ll have a voice in the
                    Community Fund and how we spend it. Holders have already
                    purchased land in the Metaverse. As a Sad Gorilla, we also
                    care a lot about water. A portion of your Hangry Sad Gorilla
                    purchase goes directly to bringing locally-sourced clean
                    water to developing countries through the non-profit
                    organization Charity Water.
